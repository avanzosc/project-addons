Project Budget
==============

This module extends the functionality of budgets for projects. When a
project is created it will create a budget for current year with:

* 12 lines of outgoings (one per month)
* 12 lines of incomings (one per month)
* 1 line on december 30th for outgoings
* 1 line on december 30th for incomings

It also allows creating those 26 budgetary lines for a budget with project
using a button.

When installing the module it creates two budgetary positions that must be
configured.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Invoicing* > *Configuration* > *Management* > *Budgetary Positions*.
#. Configure **Income** and **Outcome** accounts.
