============
Project Team
============

This module is intended to define a team for the project. A team is composed
of system users, each of them can take part with a percent of the time that
the project is going to take.

The project time can be defined by project or taken from the planned time of
the project tasks.

To compute how many hours a member is going to spend working on the project
there also are start and end dates, that can be defined per project or they
can be taken from its tasks.

There is a new view in order to view different time configurations, that is only
visible for a group. You can configure it in settings or select only those users
that will be allowed to see it. This info is only for planning purposes.
